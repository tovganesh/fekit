Rust Library for Chemistry

# Introduction
I had written MeTAStudio () as a part of my Ph.D. That was in pure Java, it also included, probably a first attempt to write QM code entirely in Java. 
I am starting this project, basically to port some of the libraries I wrote in MeTAStudio to Rust, that language that I am currently trying to learn as my side project.
