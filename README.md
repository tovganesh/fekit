# fekit
Rust Library for Chemistry

# Introduction
I had written MeTAStudio (https://github.com/tovganesh/metastudio/) as a part of my Ph.D. That was in pure Java, it also included, probably a first attempt to write QM code entirely in Java. 
I am starting this project, basically to port some of the libraries I wrote in MeTAStudio to Rust, that language that I am currently trying to learn as my side project. 

# Naming
fekit - is a ploy on "Fe" being Iron, somewhat relating to "rust", and kit coming from a popular chemestry toolkit called RDKit (https://rdkit.org/)
